# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
This analysis has been assembled to assess reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine Program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. This analysis focuses on products in the Grocery category of AMazon, to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from the Vine members in the dataset.


## Results: 
- There were 26,437 total reviews assessed for this analysis, divided between Vine and non-Vine reviewers.
- 18 5-star reviews were from Vine reviewers, while 14630 reviews were from non-Vine reviewers.
- Less than .1% of Vine reviews were 5 stars, while 99.9% of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars.

## Summary: 
From this analysis, there would appear to be no positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program when examining groceries. 99% of the positive reviews examined were from non-Vine accounts. With so few 5-star Vine-reviews, it would be more helpful to examine the breakdown of all star counts to find out whether there's a negative bias for grocery reviews in the Vine program, or if Vine-reviewers are less likely to purchase groceries through Amazon.
